# Scientific_data_work_Kitakyushu_campus_building
This repository is for data processing of Kitakyushu_campus_building Dataset. The dataset provides valuable information on a specific research topic and is accompanied by code files that facilitate data analysis and exploration.
# Dataset
The dataset included in this repository covers a measurement period from June 1, 2001, to October 31, 2022. However, it should be noted that there is a gap in the data for March 2011 due to an earthquake event. Apart from this isolated incident, the dataset remains intact for all other periods.
# Code Files
The repository includes the following code files:
1. Data_processing_xxx.py and Data_processing_xxx_Time series.py: These code files are responsible for filtering the data from the CSV file and expanding it into an hour-by-hour time series format. The filtered data consists of energy station load data, energy station power and gas purchases, energy station heat recovery, and weather files. The code in these files performs data processing tasks and transforms the raw data into a suitable format for further analysis.
2. Scientific_data_Figure.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook file contains code for visualizing the test data that has been filtered and processed. It provides code snippets and functions for generating plots and graphs based on the selected data. Researchers can refer to this file to create visual representations of the analyzed data.
For more detailed information and the implementation of data filtering, processing, and visualization tasks, please refer to the respective code files.
